Write-Host "===============================" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "`nImprovement Summary:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• Wind direction changes: Gradual transitions over 60 seconds (vs instant)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "• Weather patterns: 5-20 minute realistic weather systems" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "• Movement smoothing: 70% reduction in direction change abruptness" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "• Micro-variations: Tiny realistic fluctuations for natural movement" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "`n1. Checking existing rover data..."

    Write-Host "??  Found existing rover data" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "   The simulator will recreate this file with smooth data" -ForegroundColor Yellow
} else {
    Write-Host "? No existing rover data found - will create new smooth data" -ForegroundColor Green
}

Write-Host "`n2. Starting smooth rover simulator..."
Write-Host "   Watch for 'SMOOTH MOVEMENT' and 'NEW PATTERN' indicators" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   Press Ctrl+C to stop when you have enough smooth data" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`n3. What to expect:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Much smaller wind direction changes between points" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Wind speed transitions happen gradually" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Weather patterns lasting several minutes" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Smoother rover movement path" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "`n4. After generating data:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Run ConvertWinddataToPolygon to create smooth polygons" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Start your Blazor app to see much smoother visualization" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Wind feathers should change gradually between measurements" -ForegroundColor White
